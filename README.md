## Intro
This is my Automatic Whiteboard Eraser project which I call **AutoErase** and powered by Arduino. This is a final-year project for my college

## Component used
- Arduino Uno x1
- Breadboard x1
- Mini breadboard x1
- Hobby DC motor x4
- Jumper wires
- L298N Motor Driver x1
- Ultrasonic Sensor x2
- Rocker Switch x1
- i8650 Li-Ion Batteries x2

## To-Do list
- ~~Start the process with Pushbutton~~
- ~~Measure distance on left side~~
- ~~Measure distance on right side~~
- ~~Make both motors rotate (a 9v battery isn't enough apparently)~~
- Power Arduino with solar panel

## Additional Options
- Add remote control feature
- add OLED display for aesthetic

## Known Issues
- Arduino can't powered by solar yet
- ~~The center of whiteboard is hard to erase because of the gap between erasers~~
